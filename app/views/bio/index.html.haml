- xiaohan_info = {:name => "Xiaohan Zhang", :about => " Xiaohan (Han-Han) began his music career at the age of six, when his parents enrolled him for lessons in classical violin. He discovered modern music at the age of 14 when his friends took pity on him only having four songs on his iPod shuffle. He flirted with the guitar in his teenage years but eventually settled on the drums. He formed a band with his best friends throughout high school, which eventually came to an end as people parted ways. He's currently studying EECS in Berkeley."}
- timur_info = {:name => "Timur Bazhirov", :about => "Owes his soul to music. Born in 1986 in Soviet Russia's Kazan city. Had absorbed the after-Soviet's-fall's infusion of western music with mother milk during the 1990s on tape recorders and old vinyls. Always wanted to start a band and get big. At some point started to find himself at 3 am in the morning writing lyrics and music regularly, and thought: \"That's the F***ing Time!\". Physics PhD student in his 5th year." }
- christian_info = {:name => "Christian Cazares", :about => " Christian was born the in city of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. After spending his childhood in Mexico, his family migrated to the U.S. for reasons beyond his comprehension. He spent his teenage years in the blistering sun of Calexico, CA. He soon noticed the correlation between playing an instrument and attention received from girls, so one day he decided to finally pick up the bass guitar and teach himself some goddamn music. He's currently a 3rd year Cognitive Science student." }
- tanooj_info = {:name => "Tanooj Shah", :about => " Tanooj's true introduction to music occurred when he first listened to Iron Maiden and picked up a guitar, both within a few days of each other. Since then, he's broadened his musical palette, which ranges from stoner metal to Celtic folk. Largely influenced by guitarists like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Adrian Smith and all the other standard blues rock legends, he still spends much of his time after solos thinking about all the awesome licks that he could have played instead of that weird one. Currently a 2nd year Physics major, he's also trying to pick up a new instrument, although he hasn't decided which one yet." }
- tzuhan_info = {:name => "Tzu-Han Jan", :about => " Tzu-Han (TJ) is the only member that is actually born in the US, but is very proud of his Taiwanese heritage. TJ is currently an EECS student at Berkeley. Taking classical piano private lessons for twelve years since he was 5 years old, TJ started developing his interest in other types of music in college by jamming with friends. He plays on his keyboard whenever he can get the chance." }
